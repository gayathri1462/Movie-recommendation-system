# Movie-recommendation-system

Recommendation systems are a collection of algorithms used to recommend items to users based on information taken from the user. These systems have become ubiquitous can be commonly seen in online stores, movies databases and job finders. In this notebook, we will explore Content-based recommendation systems and implement a simple version of one using Python and the Pandas library.

Content-Based or Item-Item recommendation systems technique attempts to figure out what a user's favourite aspects of an item is, and then recommends items that present those aspects. In our case, we're going to try to figure out the input's favourite genres from the movies and ratings given.
